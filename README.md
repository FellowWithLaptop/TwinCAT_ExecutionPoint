# TwinCAT_ExecutionPoint
In TwinCAT there are some functions available for debugging. The best known is probably the breakpoint. But this is used with caution, because it stops a running machine immediately. Therefore it is often avoided by programmers by using counters or flags to check the sequence of a control.  Beside the breakpoint there is also the execution point, which was not known to me before. I suspect that many are not aware of this feature and so I would like to share it briefly. 


If you are looking for the documentation of this function from Beckhoff you will find it [here.](https://infosys.beckhoff.com/content/1033/tc3_plc_intro/2527568011.html?id=5008915087046204059 "Beckhoff")
